# Assignment 1

## Exercise 1 

Create a GitHub account and join the [GitHub classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/no15MntJ).

Once the cloning process is done create a new file in this repository via the web interface. Use `introduction.md` as file name.

Inside the file, first enter the following information:

* **Name**: {your name here}
* **E-Mail**: {your smail address here}

Then, answer the following questions:

1. Do you have any prior experience in the field introduced in the introductory session? If so, give a short overview on them.
2. What expectations or wishes do you have on the data modeling course?

Make use of some Markdown formatting like headings and lists when answering these questions, when appropriate.

Below the editor, leave the option "Commit directly to the master branch." checked and click "Commit new file".

## Exercise 2 

### Task 1
Complete the lessons from the interactive online course at [linuxjourney.com](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell) on learning the command line. Do the quizes in each of the lectures.

Prove your completion with a photo that shows your student ID card and the correct results of the quizes. Make at least 3 photos according to the three digits of your student ID. For example: Your student ID is 1110341 -> Photos of exercises 3, 4, and 1. 

### Task 2
Building on exercise 1: Use your new knowledge to count the number of lines in your `introduction.md` file from exercise 1.
Redirect the result to a file, e.g. `lines.txt`.
Print the content of the file to the console.

To submit your solution, copy the commands and their outputs from the shell (including prompt) to a new *markdown-formated file* `exercise2.md`. Make use of the markdown markup for verbatim code blocks to render it nicely in monospace font.
